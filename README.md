# Sleep Health and Lifestyle – Data Visualization

## Overview
This project explores sleep patterns and their relationship with stress,
physical activity, and lifestyle factors using exploratory data visualization.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset
- Description: Includes information on sleep duration, sleep quality,
  stress level, physical activity, BMI category, occupation, and sleep disorders.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle Notebooks

## Key Visualizations
- Distribution of sleep duration
- Stress level vs sleep duration
- Average sleep duration by gender
- Physical activity vs quality of sleep
- Distribution of sleep disorders
- Sleep duration by occupation

## Key Insights
- Most individuals sleep between 6–8 hours
- Higher stress levels are associated with shorter sleep duration
- Higher physical activity correlates with better sleep quality
- Sleep duration varies across occupations

## How to Run
Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle to reproduce the analysis.
